# Reflection â€“ 3D Scene and Design Decisions

### How do I approach designing software?

While working on this project, I developed new skills in breaking down complex scenes into manageable components. I learned how to start by identifying the basic shapes needed for each object and then layering the transformations and textures to create more detailed and realistic models. My design process involved first roughing out the overall layout of the scene, then refining each object one at a time, paying careful attention to texture mapping and visual coherence.

In future projects, I can apply this structured, incremental approach by always beginning with a clear plan. I will start by focusing first on broad structures and shapes before getting caught up in details. This course helped reinforce the value of working methodically and checking each component individually before assembling them into a final system.

### How do I approach developing programs?

Throughout the development of the scene, I used several new strategies. One major shift was the way I used modular programming: organizing object creation and rendering logic into custom functions such as `RenderMug()`, `RenderChest()`, and `RenderBook()`. This kept my code organized, readable, and easier to debug when small changes were made.

Iteration was also an important part of the development process. I would implement an object, test how it looked and behaved, and then refine the scale, position, or texture application based on the results. If an approach didn't produce the results I wanted, I wasn't afraid to revise my methods.

My coding style evolved significantly over the course of the milestones. Early on, I focused mostly on getting objects drawn correctly. As I progressed, I improved how I structured my code, added better user interaction, and learned how to manage material properties systematically to improve the overall realism of the scene.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Working with computational graphics and visualizations provided me with a much deeper understanding of how 3D applications are structured, lighting models, and coordinate systems. These skills are transferable to many fields of computer science, especially game development, simulation, or any field requiring 3D visualization.

Professionally, this experience strengthened my ability to write cleaner, modular code and debug visual programs effectively. It also helped me build confidence in navigating OpenGL, setting up rendering contexts with GLFW, and working directly with low level graphics APIs, opening the door to more advanced work in graphics programming in the future. As I continue developing my portfolio, these skills will be valuable assets that I can showcase to future employers.
